Hello my name is Roshan. I am 17 years old. I live in Ottawa, Canada and currently am in grade 12 at Longfields-Davidson Heights Secondary School. My parents are from Sri Lanka, but I was born here in Ottawa. I have one older sister who was also born here. I enjoy coding and doing math and have taken some courses online to learn how to code HTML and C++. During my free time, I play soccer and basketball with different leagues. One of my favourite things is travelling as I love visiting new places. In the future, I plan to go to Ottawa University or Waterloo University for computer sciences. I am proficient in coding in the following languages: C++, Python, Java, HTML and P5. I love coding.
